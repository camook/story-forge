# Implementation Phases Plan

A practical, phased roadmap to deliver a React + Hono + Vite + TypeScript app running on Cloudflare Workers via Wrangler. Types are strict, APIs are typed, and security/performance are first-class. PWA is optional and only enabled when requested.

---

## Phase 0 — Discovery & Scope Lock
- Goals: Confirm requirements, data model, bindings, and environments.
- Key Decisions: Which bindings (KV/D1/R2/DO/Queues/Vectorize), auth strategy (Bearer/JWT), routing shape, static asset serving.
- Deliverables:
  - Draft `ARCHITECTURE.md` (routes, data flow, bindings).
  - `wrangler.json` skeleton with placeholder bindings and `env.staging` and `env.prod` sections.
  - Initial risk list + success metrics.
- Acceptance:
  - Stakeholders sign off on scope and bindings.
  - Local dev assumptions documented (package manager, Node version, Wrangler version).

## Phase 1 — Project Scaffold (Workers-first)
- Tasks:
  - Initialize project; add deps: `react`, `react-dom`, `hono`, `typescript`, `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`.
  - Tooling: ESLint, Prettier, Vitest (unit), basic config files.
  - Create structure: `/worker` (Hono/Worker entry), `/src` (React app), root configs.
  - TS strict settings: `strict: true`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`.
  - NPM scripts: `dev` (wrangler dev + vite), `build` (vite build), `deploy` (wrangler deploy).
- Deliverables:
  - `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `wrangler.json`, `.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`.
  - Minimal React app renders; Worker responds with "ok".
- Acceptance:
  - `wrangler dev` runs the Worker and serves the SPA shell locally.
  - Type-check, lint, and unit tests execute successfully.

## Phase 2 — Worker Core & Middleware (Hono)
- Tasks:
  - Define `type Env = { Bindings: { /* KV/D1/R2/DO/Queues/Vectorize */ } }` and `const app = new Hono<Env>()`.
  - Middleware: request logging, centralized error handler, minimal CORS.
  - Routes: `GET /healthz` → `{ status: "ok" }`, `GET /api/time` → ISO timestamp.
  - Typed JSON responses; set `content-type` and sane cache headers.
- Deliverables:
  - `/worker/index.ts` exporting `{ fetch }` from `app.fetch`.
  - Integration tests using `app.fetch` for `/healthz` and `/api/time`.
- Acceptance:
  - Error paths return typed JSON with explicit status codes.
  - No unhandled promise rejections during tests.

## Phase 3 — Frontend Shell (React)
- Tasks:
  - SPA scaffold in `/src`: layout, theme variables, accessibility baseline (focus styles, semantics).
  - Fetch `/api/time`; implement loading/empty/error states and basic error boundary + Suspense.
  - Optional light client routing; keep it minimal.
- Deliverables:
  - `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`, minimal styles.
  - Utility for fetch wrappers with narrow types.
- Acceptance:
  - App renders; data loads from Worker; states are visible and accessible.

## Phase 4 — Dev/Build Integration (Vite + Assets)
- Tasks:
  - `@vitejs/plugin-react` configured; dev proxy `/api` → Worker (or single process template).
  - Output `dist/` assets; Worker serves hashed static assets via an assets manifest/static handler.
  - Ensure correct cache headers for static vs API responses.
- Deliverables:
  - `vite.config.ts` with dev proxy.
  - Worker static asset handler.
- Acceptance:
  - `vite build` + `wrangler dev` serve the built app correctly.

## Phase 5 — Data & Bindings Integration
- Tasks:
  - Wire required bindings in `wrangler.json` (placeholders first, real IDs per-env later).
  - Implement minimal usage samples:
    - KV: config/cache read/write.
    - D1: schema bootstrap + simple query if relational data is needed.
    - R2: upload/download flow demo if blobs are needed.
    - DO: coordination/state example if concurrency is needed.
    - Queues: enqueue + consumer stub if async work is needed.
    - Vectorize: index + query if semantic search is in scope.
- Deliverables:
  - Binding-safe utilities and typed wrappers.
  - Sample `/api/*` endpoints demonstrating each selected binding.
- Acceptance:
  - Local dev works with stub or dev resources; failures return typed errors.

## Phase 6 — Auth & Security
- Tasks:
  - Minimal CORS; strict origins in non-dev.
  - Auth middleware (Bearer/JWT). Token validation and typed `c.get("auth")` context.
  - Security headers (CSP best-effort for SPA), no secrets on client, input validation/sanitization.
- Deliverables:
  - Auth checker, secure cookie support if needed (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).
- Acceptance:
  - Protected routes require valid token; unauthorized → 401 JSON with reason.

## Phase 7 — Testing & Quality
- Tasks:
  - Unit tests: pure logic/components with Vitest.
  - Integration tests: Hono handlers via `app.fetch` (happy + error paths).
  - Optional E2E with Playwright for critical flows.
  - Continuous checks: lint, type-check, unit, build scripts.
- Deliverables:
  - `vitest.config.ts`, test utilities, CI instructions.
- Acceptance:
  - Tests pass locally; core routes and UI states covered.

## Phase 8 — PWA (Optional Trigger)
- Tasks (only if requested):
  - `manifest.webmanifest`: name, short_name, icons (512/192 maskable), start_url, display, colors.
  - Service Worker: register on load; strategies → network-first for `/api/*`, stale-while-revalidate for static; version caches.
  - Offline UX: read-only fallback; avoid caching authenticated responses unless token-bound and short-lived.
- Deliverables:
  - Manifest linked in `index.html`; SW registration code; conservative cache management.
- Acceptance:
  - Lighthouse PWA checks pass; installability works over HTTPS.

## Phase 9 — Documentation
- Tasks:
  - `README.md`: stack overview, dev commands, bindings setup, deploy & rollback steps, links to docs.
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md`: routes, data flow, bindings, error handling, security.
  - Keep `agents.md` concise and actionable; cross-link.
- Deliverables:
  - Updated docs aligned with reality.
- Acceptance:
  - A new contributor can clone, dev, and deploy following README.

## Phase 10 — Environments & Deployments (Wrangler)
- Tasks:
  - Configure `env.staging` and `env.prod` with separate bindings in `wrangler.json`.
  - `wrangler dev` for local; `wrangler deploy` for environments.
  - Document rollback steps and smoke tests.
- Deliverables:
  - `wrangler.json` finalized with envs; deploy scripts verified.
- Acceptance:
  - Staging and prod deploys succeed; rollback procedure validated.

## Phase 11 — Observability & Operations
- Tasks:
  - Logging strategy; error aggregation; consider Workers Analytics Engine or third-party integration.
  - Basic runtime metrics and alerting plan.
  - Rate limiting and abuse mitigation if exposed publicly.
- Deliverables:
  - Ops checklist and dashboard links (if applicable).
- Acceptance:
  - Clear runbook for on-call triage and error handling.

## Phase 12 — Hardening & Performance
- Tasks:
  - Accessibility checks (WCAG AA), keyboard nav, reduced motion support.
  - Lighthouse/Web Vitals; code-splitting and route-level lazy loading.
  - Load and error budget validation; cache tuning.
- Deliverables:
  - Performance budget notes and improvements list.
- Acceptance:
  - LCP/TTI within targets; no obvious regressions after minification.

***
- Guardrails: No Cloudflare Pages. Avoid Node-only APIs. Prefer Web/Fetch/URL APIs. Keep caches conservative. Types stay strict.
