# Phase 9 â€” Documentation

## Overview
Document the stack, workflows, bindings, and operational procedures for new contributors.

## Tasks
- Update `README.md`: stack overview, dev commands, binding setup, deploy & rollback steps, links to docs.
- Update `ARCHITECTURE.md`: routes, data flow, bindings, error handling, security posture.
- Cross-link `agents.md` for guardrails and quick prompts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A new contributor can clone, run dev, and deploy following the README.
- Architecture reflects the actual implementation.

## Codex Prompts
- "Author/Update README with setup, dev, test, build, deploy, and rollback instructions; include Wrangler/BINDINGS notes."
- "Refresh ARCHITECTURE.md to mirror current routes, data flow, and security model."

## Guardrails
- Keep docs concise and actionable; prefer links to long explanations.
