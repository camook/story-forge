# Phase 11 â€” Observability & Operations

## Overview
Introduce logging, metrics, and operational readiness for production.

## Tasks
- Define logging structure and error aggregation approach.
- Optionally integrate Workers Analytics Engine or third-party logging.
- Outline basic runtime metrics and alerting plan.
- Add basic rate limiting/abuse mitigation if publicly exposed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Errors and key events are visible and traceable.
- Runbook exists for triage and incident response.

## Codex Prompts
- "Add structured logging helpers and ensure errors include request IDs/correlation where possible."
- "Integrate Workers Analytics Engine (or stub) for request metrics; document dashboards."
- "Implement a simple rate limiter middleware (if needed) and document configuration."

## Guardrails
- Avoid leaking PII in logs; redact sensitive values.
